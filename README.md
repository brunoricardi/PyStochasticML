# Stochastic Approach to Machine Learning Techniques

This is a series of lessons extracted from *Machine Learning : A Probabilistic Perspective*, by Kevin P. Murphy, ISBN 978-0-262-01802-9. The theory that is presented in the notebooks of each lesson is completely based on this reference, which should be consulted with more details are wanted. The problems are also from the book. Coding implementations in Python are entirely a work from Bruno Abreu and, in spite of being public, should be referenced if used elsewhere.
